This site is still under construction, but here are a few resources that I have to provide.

### Table Rules

[Head here for my Table Rules.](/dnd/rules/)

The short version is that PHB +1 is fine without modification. I have a few classes that I have modified, in particularm I use the Revised Ranger, and a different Way of the Four Elements. In general, use point buy or standard array for your character's stats.

### Table Resources

Due to the need for a more well defined resource for all character options, I have elected to reproduce all character options currently accepted at my table. However, due to copyright restrictions, I must ask that you neither reproduce these files, nor share them with anyone not at the table. This will include all PHB options, some Unearthed Arcana Options, and on special occasion, even a homebrew or two. Ask me, and I may even expand this list.

Do not upload them to the internet unless otherwise directed. I have paid to have this material myself, so I do not mind sharing it with you, but if these files are released, it is possible my website will be issued a cease and desist for future content.

In an attempt to keep the chance of retribution as low as possible, I will not be including any images in my write ups.
