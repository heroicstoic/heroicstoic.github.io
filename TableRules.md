# Table Rules for D&D

I run 5th edition D&D! If you want a seat at my table feel free to ask! I do have a few guidelines for playing, so just have a look at my rules and guidelines you should look at before coming to the table.

## My Style

I tend to like a nice, roleplay heavy game. Expect 2-3 combat encounters a night, and a good amount of roleplay. The combats tend to be longer than most other DMs, which is something I am trying to improve on. I also expect that you will probably be keeping notes, and paying attention when it isn't your turn or when you aren't in the spotlight is often necessary.

If this is your first game, and many of the players at the table are also new, I will be using the vanilla initiative. If not, there is an initiative variant that I prefer to use, as it is quicker and more chaotic. I do not use this variant online.

## Etiquitte
###### 1) Please be kind to the fellow players and their playstyles
Sometimes the majority of the table wants to chat, but you want to move on to the next combat, or visa versa. Feel free to bring this up after the session, but saying "Can we just fight something?" in the middle of a diplomatic encounter is not appreciated.

###### 2) Pay Attention
Just because I am not talking to you, or it isn't your turn, doesn't mean you can just tune out and check out reddit. D&D is all about hanging out with friends and having a good time. This applies doubly in person. If I see you on your phone, and aren't using a digital character sheet, I will ask you to turn it off. Also, please, please, don't bring a book to the session.
